# Paymaster Management App

## Introduction

The Paymaster Policy Manager is a management tool for creating, editing, and monitoring Paymaster
policies. It‚Äôs designed for ecosystem and dApp managers who need fine-grained control over gas
sponsorship rules and visibility into how those policies are being used.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Git**
- **Node.js 22** - Using [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) is recommended for Node.js version
  management
- **corepack** - Bundled with Node.js; enable it by running `corepack enable`
- **Docker** and **Docker Compose** - Required for containerized development

### Local Development Setup

1. **Clone the repository and navigate to the project:**

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd Paymaster-Management-App
   ```

2. **Set up Node.js version:**

   ```bash
   nvm install && nvm use
   ```

3. **Enable corepack (if a new Node.js version was installed):**

   ```bash
   corepack enable
   ```

4. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

5. **Configure environment variables:**

   ```bash
   cp apps/backend/.env.example apps/backend/.env
   cp packages/prisma/.env.example packages/prisma/.env
   ```

6. Start the database

   ```bash
   docker compose up -d backend-db
   ```

7. Apply migrations and seed the database

   ```bash
   # Apply migrations
   pnpm prisma:migrate:deploy

   # Seed the database
   pnpm prisma:seed
   ```

8. **Start development servers:**

   ```bash
   pnpm start:dev
   ```

### Available Scripts

#### Development

- `pnpm start:dev` - Start all development servers (frontend + backend) with TUI dashboard
- `pnpm build` - Build all packages and applications
- `pnpm test` - Run all tests across the monorepo

#### Code Quality

- `pnpm lint` - Lint all TypeScript code (exits with error if issues found)
- `pnpm lint:fix` - Lint and auto-fix issues where possible
- `pnpm format:check` - Check code formatting (exits with error if not formatted)
- `pnpm format:fix` - Format all code using Prettier

#### Cleanup

- `pnpm clean:all` - Clean all build artifacts, dependencies, and caches
- `pnpm clean:dist` - Remove build output directories
- `pnpm clean:coverage` - Remove test coverage reports
- `pnpm clean:turbo` - Clear Turborepo cache
- `pnpm clean:node-modules` - Remove all node_modules directories

#### Working with Specific Apps

Use the `--filter` flag to run commands on specific applications:

```bash
pnpm build --filter=backend    # Example: build only backend
```

## üê≥ Docker

### Run application with Docker Compose

1. **Build and run all services:**

   ```bash
   docker compose up --build
   ```

2. **Access the applications:**
   - **Frontend:** http://localhost:8080
   - **Backend API:** http://localhost:3000
   - **API Documentation:** http://localhost:3000/docs

3. **Run in detached mode:**

   ```bash
   docker compose up -d --build
   ```

4. **Stop services:**
   ```bash
   docker compose down
   ```

## Milestones

Welcome to the 1st milestone of the Patterns Paymaster Management App!

We have implemented SIWE authentication so you'll need a supported wallet to login :) Please note
that this is just a frontend preview so the application is not functional. All data is mocked up and
most buttons will not work as they require fully operational backend.

After clicking on "New policy", you'll be able to access the creation of a new policy:
