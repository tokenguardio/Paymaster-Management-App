## Milestones

Welcome to the 1st milestone of the Patterns Paymaster Management App!

We have implemented SIWE authentication so you'll need a supported wallet to login :) Please note
that this is just a frontend preview so the application is not functional. All data is mocked up and
most buttons will not work as they require fully operational backend.
